Python 3 re-do of The Dungeon of Danger

The Dungeon of Danger
By Howard Berenban (c) 1983

From the book, "Mostly BASIC: Applications for your Atari, Book 2"

So, here we go again.

Notes:
02/24/2020: The GOTO is strong with this one. To the point where I need to keep track
of what BASIC line I'm going from, to which one I'm going to. Variable names are iffy
as I don't know what all of them do, yet. And some just seem to magically appear. My
brain is breaking.
